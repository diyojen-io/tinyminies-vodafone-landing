        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>

          Both these Terms and separate terms of service or sale documents may
          apply to your use of the Services or to a sweepstakes, service or
          product offered via the Services (Additional Terms). To the extent
          there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms,

        <h3>2. Modifications to these Terms</h3>

          indicate the new effective date at the top of the document.
          Depending on the type of change, we may also provide you other
          reasonable means of notification as required by applicable law. Your

        <p>
          For certain types of Accounts or to access certain features of the
          Services, we may charge a fee, such as an Account fee or
          subscription fee. All fees are payable in accordance with payment
          terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable.
        </p>

          For example, we offer our Tiny Minies Premium subscription for a
          fee. You can access Tiny Minies Premium in the following ways: by
          purchasing a subscription to the Services from the site, within the
          app, where allowed by the app marketplace partners, or through a
          bundle with one or more of our bundle subscription partners.

              mechanism accepted by us (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple’s
              iTunes App Store) (Pay Mechanism) to activate and maintain a
              paid Account. You authorize us to charge you through the Pay
              Mechanism that you use. You will also be responsible for charges
              for any products or services that you order that are offered for
              sale through the Services. If we do not receive payment from the
              Pay Mechanism you use, you agree to pay all amounts due
              hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any
              dispute with your payment provider. Should the Pay Mechanism
              provided initially be declined for insufficient funds or any
              other reason, we reserve the right to attempt to recharge the
              Pay Mechanism in full or in lesser installments of the initially
              incurred charge. You will be solely responsible for all
              overdraft fees and/or penalties that may be assessed by your
              payment provider.

              update your Account and other information, including your email

              can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. We use

              behalf. You acknowledge and agree that in the event the
              third-party payment processor experiences a data breach that
              affects your information through no fault of the Company, the
              Company will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any
              such breach to the maximum extent permitted under applicable
              law.

              to any
              applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund
              the app purchase price to you (if applicable) and, to the
              maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no
              other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app.
              Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any
              third party relating to the app or your possession and use of
              it, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims;
              (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable
              legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under
              consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not
              responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and
              discharge of any third-party claim that your possession and use
              of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property
              rights. Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries
              of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple
              will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
              right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party
              beneficiary thereof.

                  ">Subscription Renewal. </span>By purchasing a subscription, you agree that in accordance with
              applicable law, we may renew your subscription automatically for
              the same subscription term on the day after your previous
              subscription term ends, and you authorize us to charge you for
              the new subscription term, unless you cancel your Account prior
              to the subscription renewal date through the procedures
              described in the Subscription Cancellation section below. We
              will charge your credit card (or another Pay Mechanism initially
              used by you) each year, month, or other applicable period
              (depending on the term that you selected) for the then-current
              applicable price. The billing period for your subscription fee
              begins from the time of registration (i.e., when you register,
              enter your Pay Mechanism and pay the initial subscription fee),
              and again at the start of each subsequent subscription period.
              If any subscription fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your
              transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to
              suspend, disable, cancel, or terminate your subscription. You
              acknowledge that billing may not occur on the exact same date of
              each month. Your subscription continues until canceled by you,
              or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or
              subscription in accordance with these Terms.

              Services for free or at special discounted prices. If you sign
              up for a trial subscription, your rights to use the Services are
              limited by the terms of such trial and will terminate or renew
              according to the terms of your trial arrangement and/or any
              applicable Additional Terms. You may cancel your Account during
              your promotional period to avoid being charged the full

              Kids in
              its sole discretion and we may change our fees from time to
              time. Gamester Kids or its partners will send notice of upcoming
              automatic renewal prior to renewing your subscription if
              required by law. We may change the subscription terms,
              subscription fees, or other fees at any time on a going forward
              basis at our sole discretion. If the pricing for your
              subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an
              opportunity to change or cancel your subscription before
              applying those changes to your Account or charging you in
              connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole
              discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from
              an Account or subscription. Where legally permissible, your
              continued enrolment in your Account after the changes become
              effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you
              do not wish to continue your subscription at the revised rates
              and/or terms, you must let us know prior to the end of your
              then-current subscription period in accordance with the
              Subscription Cancellation section below, so that at the end of
              that subscription period, your subscription will end. Otherwise,
              the revised rate and/or terms will apply on and from the next
              subscription period.

              before the renewal date, outside of iTunes App Store
              subscriptions. If you downloaded our app through Apple’s iTunes
              App Store, you must follow the cancellation instructions
              provided in the iTunes App Store. For all Accounts, you will
              continue to have access to your Account for the period of time
              that has already been prepaid. If you activated a paid Account
              at a discounted or promotional rate, chose to pay in
              installments, and then canceled that Account prior to all of the
              installments having been paid, the period of time after the
              cancellation that your Account will continue to be accessible
              will be calculated based on the non-promotional/non-discounted
              rate in effect at the time of cancellation. After you cancel
              your Account, we will not charge you any subscription fees after
              the expiration of your then-current subscription. Please note we
              do not provide full or partial refunds for prepaid sums, except
              where required by law. In any event, you will be able to
              continue to use the Services throughout the remainder of the
              subscription period for which you have already paid.

              claims against Gamester Kids and its third-party affiliates,
              including Gamester Kids’ third-party payment processor(s),
              related to any unauthorized payments made on or through the use
              of your Account outside of Gamester Kids’ control, regardless of
              whether such payments are authorized by you. However, you may
              submit a claim of the unauthorized payment to Gamester Kids so
              that Gamester Kids can conduct a reasonable investigation as it
              sees fit under the circumstances. If appropriate, Gamester Kids
              will assist in correcting the alleged unauthorized payment,
              provided that such claim is received by Gamester Kids within
              thirty (30) days of the disputed charge or payment.

          construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Turkiye,
          without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. The exclusive
          jurisdiction for all Disputes (as defined below) that you and
          Gamester Kids will be the courts located in Istanbul, Turkiye.
        </p>
        <h3>13. Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION
          (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE
          MOST DISPUTES WITH GAMESTER KIDS AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
          LEGAL RIGHTS.
        </p>
        <p>
          YOU AND GAMESTER KIDS AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM
          ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING
          WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED
          THROUGH THE SERVICES, THESE TERMS, OR CONTENT (A “DISPUTE” AS
          DEFINED BELOW) SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING,
          INDIVIDUAL BILATERAL ARBITRATION, AS DETAILED BELOW.
        </p>
        <h3>14. Additional Legal Terms</h3>
        <p>
          To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the following
          additional legal terms shall apply:
        </p>
        <h5>14.1. WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS</h5>
        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
          LEGAL RIGHTS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gamester Kids and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual
          capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class,
          consolidated, or representative proceeding. Gamester Kids and you
          further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or
          representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third
          party arising out of or relating to any dispute with a third party.
          If an Arbitrator or a Court determines that applicable law precludes
          enforcement of this Paragraph’s limitations as to a particular
          remedy, then the portion of the claim seeking that remedy (and only
          that portion of the claim) must be severed from the arbitration and
          may be brought in court. All other claims shall remain subject to
          arbitration solely on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s
          claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated,
          class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). The
          arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can
          only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other
          Gamester Kids Users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes
          with other Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any court or arbitrator determines that the
          class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this
          section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration
          can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then
          the disputes, claims, or controversies will not be subject to
          arbitration and must be litigated in courts located in Istanbul,
          Turkiye.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any clause within this section is found to be invalid or
          unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this
          section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full
          force and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Section will also apply to any claims asserted by you against
          any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of
          Gamester Kids, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of
          Gamester Kids, and to any claims asserted by any of them against
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Section shall survive any termination of your account or the
          Services.
        </p>
